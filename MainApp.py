                    - Every 1 - 5 minutes, batch prep will check the directory to see if there are files to process.
                    - When batch prep detects the file, it will start to process the file according the the settings.
                        * There is more information regarding the advanced settings below.  
                    - Once batch prep processes the document, it will send the file to the batch indexing service to
                      be processed into Millennium. 
                
                The image that popped open is a screenshot of the advanced settings for batch prep.

                        Yellow highlight:
                          - This is the file directory where Batch Prep is pointed to.
                          - This should match with the file directory the client gave you earlier.
                        Blue highlight:
                          - This setting tells you what batch prep will be looking for when it processes the files.
                          - In this example, Batch prep will read the file name.
                        Green highlight
                          - This is the order that the file name needs to follow so that batch prep 
                            can read the file successfully. 
                          - In this example, filename should be:
                            - batchclass_batchname_createdate_createtime_mrn_FIN_docalias_provider_trackingnbr

                Now that you have the information, we can start troubleshooting. 
                    - Step 1:
                        - Find the server that batch prep is running on 
                            * The three usual servers are:
                                - ACIS 
                                - Batch server 
                                - ERMX 
                        - On the server running Batch Prep:
                            * Open CDIConfig
                            * Go to the services tab 
                            * Select the batch prep service 
                            * Open up the advanced settings and the directory containing the files so that you can compare
                                the filename format in the advance setting vs. what is actually being sent in by the client.

                This means the document were processed by AXRM.
                
                Before starting to troubleshoot, lets go through the process the cold feed documents follow:
                    - The client or a third party sends the documents to the fileshare directory.
                    - AXRM will process the document and send the document to the upload application.
                        * The upload app is listed in the report type properties setting. 
                        * The upload app will usually be ermx_auto or cdi_auto
                    - When the documents land in the auto queue, the batch indexing service will process the documents.
                        * If successful, the image was attached to the patient's chart. 
                            - To verify, you can go to the patient's chart in PowerChart and look for the image.
                            - Or, you can search for the batch using the trans log or pending document table.
                        * If the document failed, there was an issue attaching the document to the patient's chart.
                            - The document will be sent to cer_batchindex.
                
                Tips:    
                    - If the documents are ending in .FAILEDPDF: 
                        * AXRM failed the documents.
                        * We will have to start at the beginning of the cold feed process mentioned above, which is:
                            - Documents being process in the fileshare directory by AXRM.
                    - If the documents are ending in .CXPDF:
                        * AXRM processed the documents successfully. 
                        * We can move on to the next step of the cold feed process, which is:
                            - The documents being sent to the upload app (AUTO queue).        
                    - Each report type has it's own script that it uses to read the file names, and its own logs.
                        * You can usually find these scripts and logs in 
                            - C:'\'ERMXData'\'Scripts and C:'\'ERMXData'\'RPWorking, respectively.
                    - ERMX can only process one directory at a time. If there are documents in different directories, 
                      ERMX will process one directory until all the files have been processed, 
                      before moving on to the next directory.
                
                Useful wikis:
                    - Helpful to learn how to set up the report types and any setting configuration.

                            - If documents are failing in AXRM, it is useful to go through the settings for the report type 
                              to make sure nothing is misconfigured.
                    - Useful information to learn how to read the scripts that AXRM uses to process the documents.

                Reminder:
                    - CWx owns/controls the fileshare directory. 
                    - If the files aren't making it into the directory, for whatever reason, then send the ticket 
                      to CWx as they will need to see what's blocking the files from coming through. 
                        
                Now that you have that information, let's start to troubleshoot.

                - Step 2:
                    * We need to recreate the issue so that we can see the error that is being thrown by batch prep.
                    * To recreate the issue, delete the .error at the end of the file. 
                        - This will allow batch prep to reprocess the file.  
                    * After deleting the .error, we need to open up the app that collects the logs for batch prep.
                        - Hit the start menu 
                        - Search for 'msgviewwin' and open up the application.
                        - When open, hit file -> load private file -> select cdi.mlg file.
                        - When the file has been reprocessed, hit refresh in 'msgviewwin'
                            * You should see the error message in cdi.mlg file.
                    * The error messages for Batch Prep are pretty self-explanatory. Below I listed some of the error
                      messages that I've seen.
